ShellCraft is a game about mining, crafting, and puzzling, loosely based
on Ted Chiang's short story "72 letters". But all of that doesn't matter
much now, we've got work to do. Let's start with mining some *clay* by typing

`shellcraft mine clay`"""

That's because the resources on the surface are easy to reach, but the more you
mine them, the harder it is to get more. For now, there's not much you can do about it,
however you can increase the yield of your mining operations with tools! Try crafting
a $shovel$ by running

the best tool for the job until it breaks, and then continue with the next-best tool.

ShellCraft is a hackable game. That doesn't mean that you should cheat, but rather, that you
can use your coding skills to your advantage and automate and improve some aspects of the game!

For example, let's mine *clay* ten times in a row by using this little bash script:

Some items are unlocked simply by having enough resources to craft them. Others need to be
researched first. A quick look at `shellcraft research` shows you the available research projects.
Researching doesn't cost you anything, but can take a long time that you can't spend mining or
crafting anything. So let's embark on your first science project and research the %small_cart%!"""
