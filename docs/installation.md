# Installation

## Stable release

To install ShellCraft, run this command in your terminal:

```sh
$ pipx install shellcraft
```

Using [pipx](pipx) is the recommended way of installing command-line applications written in python, as it will isolate them from the rest of your python stuff.

On macOS, you can install `pipx` with `brew install pipx`, or via pip: `python3 -m pip install --user pipx`.

If you don't have [pip](pip) installed, this [Python installation guide](python-guide) can guide you through the process.

## Running ShellCraft

To play ShellCraft, simply invoke it like this:

```sh
$ shellcraft
```

There's no need to consult the rest of the documentation right now, as the game will guide you through a tutorial and progressively explain all key gameplay elements.
