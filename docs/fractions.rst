Fractions
=========

The political landscape in ShellCraft is divided into many fractions, each with their own objectives.

Political Beliefs
-----------------

Aristocracy
~~~~~~~~~~~

While only the most extremly anti-aristocratic fractions would challenge the legitimacy of the crown itself, there is a divide between fractions as to how much influence the nobility should have over political affairs.

Theocracy
~~~~~~~~~

...


Mercantilism
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libertarian fractions support free trade, oppose government rules, and will generally oppose war with other nations. On the other side of the spectrum, fractions may desire strong regulation of the markets,


Industrialism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fractions that support industrialism spend money on the research of secular euonyms and the design of new automata. Fractions opposing industrialism believe that an increase in automata will harm society, destroy jobs, and threaten the social order.
