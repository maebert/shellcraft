        Welcome to ShellCraft.

        ShellCraft is a game about mining, crafting, and puzzling, loosely based
        on Ted Chiang's short story "72 letters". But all of that doesn't matter
        much now, we've got work to do. Let's start with mining some *clay* by typing

        `shellcraft mine clay`
    effects:
        enable_commands:
          - mine
          - tutorial

        Excellent! Mining resources (like everything in ShellCraft) takes some time,
        but you're rewarded with this warm, moist, delicate... well, *clay*. Time to
        stock up on *clay* some more:

        `shellcraft mine clay`
    prerequisites:
        clay: 1

        Well done. Let's continue this until we have *4 clay*.
    prerequisites:
        clay: 2

        Notice how every time you run `shellcraft mine clay`, it takes a little longer?
        That's because the resources on the surface are easy to reach, but the more you
        mine them, the harder it is to get more. For now, there's not much you can do about it,
        however you can increase the yield of your mining operations with tools! Try crafting
        a $shovel$ by running

        `shellcraft craft shovel`

    prerequisites:
        clay: 4
    effects:
        enable_commands: craft

        Whoop whoop! Let's put this to use by running `shellcraft mine clay` again.
    prerequisites:
        items: shovel

        See how we're getting a lot more clay now? You can see which $items$ are currently
        in your posession by running `shellcraft inventory`. You can also find out much *clay*
        (and later, other resources) you have by running `shellcraft resources`.

        When you're ready, continue mining until you have *10 clay*.
    prerequisites:
        clay: 2
        items: shovel
    effects:
        enable_commands:
        - inventory
        - resources

        Oh no, our $shovel$ broke! All items have a certain durability, which is the number
        of seconds you can use them before they break. When mining, shellcraft will always pick
        the best tool for the job until it breaks, and then continue with the next-best tool.
        In this case, your bare hands.

        Let's invest a little bit into our tools and craft a $sturdy_shovel$.
    prerequisites:
        clay: 10

        The $sturdy_shovel$ costs a little more than the good ol' $shovel$ and doens't
        give us any better bonus, but it lasts four times as long! That means we can get some serious
        mining done.

        ShellCraft is a hackable game. That doesn't mean that you should cheat, but rather, that you
        can use your coding skills to your advantage and automate and improve some aspects of the game!

        For example, let's mine *clay* ten times in a row by using this little bash script:

            `for i in {1..10}; do shellcraft mine clay; done`
    prerequisites:
        items: sturdy_shovel

        Have a look at `shellcraft inventory` - our $sturdy_shovel$ is still in pretty good shape.

        Some items are unlocked simply by having enough resources to craft them. Others need to be
        researched first. A quick look at `shellcraft research` shows you the availabel research projects.
        Researching doesn't cost you anything, but can take a long time that you can't spend mining or
        crafting anything. So let's embark on your first science project and research the @small_cart@!

    prerequisites:
        clay: 20
    effects:
        enable_commands: research

        This should make our job a little easier. Keep on mining now!

    prerequisites:
        items: small_cart
