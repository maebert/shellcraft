# Installation

## Stable release

To install ShellCraft, run this command in your terminal:

```sh
$ pip install shellcraft
```

This is the preferred method to install ShellCraft, as it will always install the most recent stable release. This requires Python 2.7, or Python 3.6 or newer.

If you don't have [pip](pip) installed, this [Python installation guide](python-guide) can guide you through the process.


## Running ShellCraft

To play ShellCraft, simply invoke it like this:

```sh
$ shellcraft
```

There's no need to consult the rest of the documentation right now, as the game will guide you through a tutorial and progressively explain all key gameplay elements.
