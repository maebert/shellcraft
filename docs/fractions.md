# Fractions

The political landscape in ShellCraft is divided into many fractions, each with their own objectives.

## The Crown

The government has pledged to protect its subject from foreign interference, and preserve the structure of society. While it usually keeps out of business matters, the Crown may approach nomenclators with requests to support political efforts.

## Sculptor's Union

Sculptors and nomenclators work hand in hand in producing the latest and best automata. The sculptor's union is a political heavyweight far beyond the direct interest of just sculptors.

## The Kabbalists

Rarely interested in worldy affairs, Kabbalists study Names and employ *golems* as a form of ecstatic meditation. To most modern nomenclators, Kabbalists are obscure relics of bygone days, but they still hold considerable influence in aristocratic circles.
